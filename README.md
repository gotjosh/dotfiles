# Gotjosh's Dotfiles

Dotfiles I have carefully crafted (and gathered) over the time.

They are "heavily" inspired by [Hashrocket's Dotmatrix](http://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix), [Thoughbot's dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and I borrowed most of the `linker.sh` from [Sirupsen](http://github.com/sirupsen).

# The Setup.

| Hardware            | Terminal  | Shell  | Editor  | Version Control  |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|---------|------------------|
|  Retina Macbook 15" | iTerm     |  bash  |   Vim   |      Git         |


# Installing

### Dotfiles
Use the `bin/linker.sh` to symlink the files to the `$HOME` directory.

### Vimbundle
I use [Tim Pope's Pathogen](http://github.com/tpope) for loading `VIMbundles` and `bin/vimbundles.sh` to clone them.
